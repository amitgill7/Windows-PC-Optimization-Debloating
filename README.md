# Windows PC Optimization & Debloating Lab 💻

## Overview
This lab documents the manual optimization and deep cleaning of a Windows 11 system without the use of third-party automation tools. All changes were performed using native Windows utilities, PowerShell commands, system configuration tools, and registry settings to improve performance, reduce background processes, and enhance system responsiveness.

---

## Objectives
- Reduce RAM and CPU usage
- Remove unnecessary preinstalled applications
- Optimize startup and background services
- Improve boot time and system responsiveness
- Enhance system privacy and control over updates
- Demonstrate understanding of Windows system internals

---

## Tools Used
- Windows Task Manager
- PowerShell (Administrator)
- Services.msc
- Task Scheduler
- Disk Cleanup
- System Configuration (msconfig)
- Registry Editor
- Windows Settings

---

## System Information
- Operating System: Windows 11
- Permissions: Administrator
- Optimization Type: Manual system tuning
